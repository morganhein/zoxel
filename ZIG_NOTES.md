In Zig, the std.debug.print function is used for formatted output, similar to printf in C. Here are some of the basic string interpolation rules and symbols:  
{}: Default format, which uses the type's default formatting.
{s}: String.
{d}: Signed integer.
{u}: Unsigned integer.
{x}: Hexadecimal format for integers.
{b}: Binary format for integers.
{c}: Character.
{f}: Floating-point number.
{e}: Scientific notation for floating-point numbers.
{a}: Hexadecimal floating-point format.
{p}: Pointer.
{any}: Any type, using Zig's default formatting for that type.
